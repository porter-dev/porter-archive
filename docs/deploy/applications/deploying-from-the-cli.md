# Creating a New Application

## Overview

To create a new application via the Porter CLI, you can run:

```sh
porter create [kind] --app [app-name]
```

Required args/flags:
- `kind` can be one of `web`, `worker`, or `job`
- `app-name` must be a set of lowercase letters or digits separated by `-` 

Each `kind` of application has a set of default values which can be overwritten. For example, `web` applications have the port set to `80`. To overwrite this, for example to port `3000`, create the following file `values.yaml`:

```yaml
container:
  port: 3000
```

And then run the command:

```sh
porter create web --app web-test --values ./values.yaml
```

Go to the [common configuration options](#common-configuration-options) section to view `values.yaml` files for common use-cases. You can also view all possible configuration options in the `values.yaml` files of the respective applications: [`web`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/web/values.yaml), [`worker`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/worker/values.yaml), and [`job`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/job/values.yaml).

## Deploying from Local Files 

The default behavior of `porter create` is to use the local filesystem to build, push, and deploy a Docker image. For example, to create a new web application from the current directory, you can simply run:

```sh
porter create web --app web-test
```

Porter will look for a `Dockerfile` located at the root of the current directory. If a `Dockerfile` is found, Porter will use the default Docker container registry linked to the Porter project to deploy the application. If a `Dockerfile` is not found, Porter will use a [Cloud-Native Buildpack](https://docs.porter.run/docs/auto-deploy-requirements#auto-build-with-cloud-native-buildpacks) to build your application. 

To point to a Dockerfile, you should pass the **relative path** to the Dockerfile from the root directory of the source code:

```sh
porter create web --app web-test --dockerfile /my/nested/Dockerfile
```

To use a cloud-native buildpack instead of a Dockerfile, you can specify the method directly:

```sh
porter create web --app web-test --method pack
```

## Deploying from Github

By default, Porter will use the local filesystem to build, push, and deploy your application. Alternatively, if you have a local Git repository whose origin is set to a Github repository that matches one linked on Porter, you can pass in the `--source` flag to deploy your app:      

```sh
porter create web --app web-test --source github
```

If your local branch is set to track changes from an upstream remote branch, Porter will try to use the connected `remote` and remote branch as the Github repository to link to. Otherwise, Porter will use the remote given by `origin`, and the same branch name as your local branch. 

## Deploying from a Docker Registry 

The CLI also supports deploying directly from a Docker image which is hosted on a [connected Docker registry](https://docs.porter.run/docs/linking-an-existing-docker-container-registry). Simply specify `--source registry` and the application image via the `--image` tag:

```sh
porter create web --app web-test --source registry --image gcr.io/snowflake-12345/web-test:latest
```

# Updating an Existing Application

## Overview

You can update an existing application that was deployed from either the dashboard or the CLI. The root command for updating an application is:

```sh
porter update --app [app-name]
```

Where `app-name` is the name of a web, worker, or job application on the Porter dashboard. The default behavior of this command is to build a new image using the local filesystem, push this image to the connect image repository, and re-deploy the application on the Porter dashboard. However, each of these steps can be configured. 

As with the `porter create` command, you can update the configuration that an application uses by passing in the `--values` flag, which should pass the filepath to a `values.yaml` file. **Note that this command merges the `values.yaml` file with your existing configuration, so you should only specify options that you would like to modify**. For example, the following `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
container:
  port: 8080
```

Would only update the container port to `8080`, while keeping your existing configuration, after running the command: 

```sh
porter update --app --values ./values.yaml
```

Go to the [common configuration options](#common-configuration-options) section to view `values.yaml` files for common use-cases. You can also view all possible configuration options in the `values.yaml` files of the respective applications: [`web`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/web/values.yaml), [`worker`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/worker/values.yaml), and [`job`](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/job/values.yaml).

## Building from Local Files 

The default behavior of this command will vary depending on if the application already has a Github repository source specified:
- If this application has a linked Github repository source, it will use the build settings from the linked source. That is, if the Github build settings specify a Dockerfile, this command will use the path to that Dockerfile. 
- If the application does not have a linked source, this command will default to using a Dockerfile located at the root of the directory, at the path `./Dockerfile`. 

 These default behaviors can be overwritten through a combination of the `--method` flag, the `--dockerfile` flag, and the `--path` flag:

## Building from Github 

If you specify `--source github`, this command will look for a remote Github repository that has been linked to this application. If one is found, the command will download an archive of the Github repository from the latest commit of the linked branch, and will use that as the filesystem to build from. 

## Updating Configuration without Building

If you would only like to update the configuration for your application via a `values.yaml` file (without building a new image), you can do so with the following command:

```sh
porter update config --app [app-name] --values [values-file]
```

For example, to update the app `web-test`, and to programmatically set the environment variables for that application, create a file called `web-test-values.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
container:
  env:
    normal:
      TESTING: test-from-cli
```

If I then run `porter update config --app web-test --values web-test-values.yaml`, I will now see the new values in the application:

# Writing Custom Deployment Pipelines

While this will be a subject of a separate guide soon, this section provides an overview of how you might use certain subcommands to build your own deployment pipeline. By default, the command `porter update` performs four steps: gets the environment variables for the application, builds a new Docker container from the source files, pushes a new Docker image to the remote registry, and calls a Porter endpoint to re-deploy the application. However, we designed this command to be modular: if you would like to add intermediate steps in your own build process, you can call different `porter update` sub-commands separately:

- [`porter update get-env`](#porter-update-get-env) - prints the build environment variables to the terminal or a file.  
- [`porter update build`](#porter-update-build) - builds the Docker container used for deployment.
- [`porter update push`](#porter-update-push) - pushes the Docker container used for deployment to a remote registry.
- [`porter update config`](#porter-update-config) - calls a Porter endpoint to re-deploy the application with new configuration. 

### `porter update get-env`

Gets environment variables for a deployment for a specified application given by the `--app` flag. By default, env variables are printed via stdout for use in downstream commands:

```sh
porter update get-env --app example-app | xargs
```

Output can also be written to a dotenv file via the `--file` flag, which should specify the destination path for a `.env` file. For example:

```sh
porter update get-env --app example-app --file .env
```

### `porter update build`

Builds a new version of the application specified by the `--app` flag. Depending on the configured settings, this command may work automatically or will require a specified `--method` flag. 

If you have configured the Dockerfile path and/or a build context for this application, this command will by default use those settings, so you just need to specify the `--app` flag:

```sh
porter update build --app example-app
```

If you have not linked the build-time requirements for this application, the command will use a local build. By default, the cloud-native buildpacks builder will automatically be run from the current directory. If you would like to change the build method, you can do so by using the `--method` flag, for example:

```sh
porter update build --app example-app --method docker
```

When using `--method docker`, you can specify the path to the Dockerfile using the `--dockerfile` flag. This will also override the Dockerfile path that you may have linked for the application:

```sh
porter update build --app example-app --method docker --dockerfile ./prod.Dockerfile
```

### `porter update push`

Pushes a new image for an application specified by the --app flag. This command uses the image repository saved in the application config by default. For example, if an application "nginx" was created from the image repo "gcr.io/snowflake-123456/nginx", the following command would push the image "gcr.io/snowflake-123456/nginx:new-tag":

```sh
porter update push --app nginx --tag new-tag
```

This command will not use your pre-saved authentication set up via `docker login`, so if you are using an image registry that was created outside of Porter, make sure that you have linked it via `porter connect`.

### `porter update config`

Updates the configuration for an application specified by the --app flag, using the configuration given by the --values flag. This will trigger a new deployment for the application with new configuration set. Note that this will merge your existing configuration with configuration specified in the --values file. For example:

```sh
porter update config --app example-app --values my-values.yaml
```

You can update the configuration with only a new tag with the --tag flag, which will only update
the image that the application uses if no --values file is specified:

```sh
porter update config --app example-app --tag custom-tag
```
