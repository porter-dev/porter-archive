Every cluster provisioned by Porter by default uses an NGINX [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx) to connect your web applications to the internet. There are different options for customizing the NGINX configuration that a specific application uses. 

Most of the time, you can customize the NGINX configuration by adding an "Ingress Annotation" when deploying a web service. This can be found in the "Advanced" tab of the web template:

To add an annotation, simply click "Add row" and add key-value pairs for the annotation.

# NGINX Settings Options

## Client Max Body Size 

If you are getting undesired `413 Request Entity Too Large` errors, you can increase the maximum size of the client request by setting the field [client_max_body_size](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size). You can do this by adding the following annotation:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m
```

This will set the maximum client request body size to 8 megabytes. [Read more about NGINX units](http://nginx.org/en/docs/syntax.html).
